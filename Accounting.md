## **Module-I: Understanding the Nature of Accounting**

### 🔹 What is Accounting?

Accounting is the systematic process of **identifying**, **measuring**, **recording**, **classifying**, **summarizing**, **interpreting**, and **communicating** financial information. The primary goal is to provide accurate and timely financial data to users for decision-making.

### 🔹 Functions of Accounting

1. **Recording**: Also known as bookkeeping. It involves systematically documenting all financial transactions.
2. **Classifying**: Grouping similar items under a common category (e.g., salaries under expenses).
3. **Summarizing**: Preparing reports like Trial Balance, Profit & Loss A/c, and Balance Sheet.
4. **Interpreting**: Analyzing the summarized data to understand the financial health.
5. **Communicating**: Sharing the interpreted data with internal and external stakeholders.

### 🔹 Usefulness of Accounting

* Provides financial information to management for decision-making.
* Aids in performance evaluation and budgeting.
* Necessary for statutory compliance and tax filings.
* Facilitates comparison between different time periods and firms.

### 🔹 Accounting Equation

* **Formula**: `Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Equity`
* This equation shows the relationship between the three fundamental elements of accounting.

#### 📌 Numerical Example:

Owner starts a business by investing ₹1,00,000.

* Assets (Cash): ₹1,00,000
* Liabilities: ₹0
* Owner's Equity: ₹1,00,000

Buys equipment for ₹30,000 on credit:

* Assets increase (Equipment) ₹30,000
* Liabilities increase (Creditors) ₹30,000

### 🔹 Accounting Concepts and GAAP

#### 1. **Business Entity Concept**

The business is treated as a separate legal entity from its owners. Personal expenses of the owner are not recorded in the business books.

#### 2. **Money Measurement Concept**

Only those events that can be measured in monetary terms are recorded. For example, employee satisfaction is not recorded.

#### 3. **Going Concern Concept**

Assumes the business will operate indefinitely and not liquidate in the foreseeable future.

#### 4. **Cost Concept**

Assets are recorded at their purchase cost, not at market value or resale value.

#### 5. **Dual Aspect Concept**

Every transaction affects at least two accounts. This is the basis for the double-entry system.

#### 6. **Accrual Concept**

Transactions are recorded when they occur, not when cash is exchanged.

#### 7. **Matching Concept**

Expenses should be recognized in the same period as the revenues they help to generate.

#### 8. **Revenue Recognition Concept**

Revenue is recognized when it is earned, regardless of when the payment is received.

#### 9. **Conservatism (Prudence)**

Anticipate all possible losses but do not anticipate profits.

#### 10. **Materiality**

Only significant items that affect decision-making need to be disclosed.

#### 11. **Consistency**

The same accounting methods should be applied consistently across periods.

#### 12. **Objectivity**

Accounts should be based on objective evidence, such as invoices, receipts, and contracts.

### 🔹 GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles)

These are standardized guidelines used in accounting to ensure clarity, consistency, and comparability in the preparation of financial statements.

### 🔹 IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards)

A globally accepted framework issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that standardizes accounting across international borders. It emphasizes fair value and principle-based accounting.

## **Module-II: Double Entry System and the Accounting Cycle**

### 🔹 Concept of Double Entry

The double-entry system of accounting means every transaction affects at least two accounts—one debit and one credit—with the total debits equaling total credits. This system maintains the accounting equation and ensures accurate financial reporting.

### 🔹 The Accounting Cycle

The accounting cycle is the complete process of:

1. **Identifying Transactions**
2. **Recording in Journal (Journal Entries)**
3. **Posting to Ledger**
4. **Preparing Trial Balance**
5. **Adjusting Entries**
6. **Preparing Adjusted Trial Balance**
7. **Creating Financial Statements (P\&L, Balance Sheet)**
8. **Closing the Books**

### 🔹 Vouchers

#### What is a Voucher?

A voucher is a written document that serves as evidence of a business transaction. It is the foundation of accounting entry.

#### Types of Vouchers:

1. **Cash Voucher** – for cash payments/receipts.
2. **Bank Voucher** – for transactions via bank.
3. **Journal Voucher** – for non-cash transactions like depreciation.
4. **Purchase Voucher** – records purchase transactions.
5. **Sales Voucher** – records sales transactions.

#### Objective of Preparing Vouchers:

* Serve as proof for every transaction.
* Ensure correctness and authorization.
* Form the basis of journal entries.

### 🔹 Journal Entries

Journal is the book of original entry. It records transactions in chronological order with both debit and credit sides.

**Format of Journal Entry:**
Date | Particulars | L.F. | Debit (₹) | Credit (₹)

Example:

> Purchased goods worth ₹10,000 on credit from Ram & Co.

```
Date       Particulars                 L.F.     Debit(₹)    Credit(₹)
2025-05-01 Purchases A/c     Dr.                  10,000
                 To Ram & Co.                               10,000
```

### 🔹 Ledger

Ledger is a book that contains individual accounts (like Cash A/c, Sales A/c, etc.) derived from journal entries.

#### Format of Ledger:

```
Account Name: Cash A/c

Date       | Particulars     | J.F. | Debit(₹) | Credit(₹)
----------------------------------------------------------
01/05/25 | Capital A/c       | 001 | 50,000    | -
05/05/25 | Purchase A/c      | 002 | -         | 10,000
```

#### Importance of Ledger:

* Facilitates preparation of trial balance.
* Helps track balances of each account.
* Essential for creating financial statements.

## **Module-III: Subsidiary Books and Cash Book**

### 🔹 Introduction and Need for Subsidiary Books

Subsidiary books are specialized books of original entry that help in systematically recording frequently occurring similar transactions. Instead of recording every transaction in a general journal, businesses use subsidiary books to improve efficiency and clarity.

### 🔹 Types of Subsidiary Books

1. **Purchase Book**: Records all credit purchases of goods only.
2. **Sales Book**: Records all credit sales of goods.
3. **Purchase Return Book (Returns Outward Book)**: Records goods returned to suppliers.
4. **Sales Return Book (Returns Inward Book)**: Records goods returned by customers.

#### 🔹 Numerical Example:

> Purchased goods worth ₹50,000 on credit from Ram Traders.
> Sold goods worth ₹70,000 on credit to Shyam & Co.

Entries:

* Purchase Book: Entry for Ram Traders
* Sales Book: Entry for Shyam & Co.

### 🔹 Cash Book

The Cash Book is both a journal and a ledger. It records all cash and bank transactions.

### 🔹 Types of Cash Books:

1. **Single Column Cash Book**:

   * Only cash column
   * Records only cash receipts and payments

2. **Double Column Cash Book**:

   * Contains cash and discount columns
   * Discount allowed (Dr side) and discount received (Cr side)

3. **Triple Column Cash Book**:

   * Contains cash, bank, and discount columns
   * Records all cash and bank transactions along with discounts

#### Example: Triple Column Format

```
Date | Particulars | Disc. | Cash | Bank | Date | Particulars | Disc. | Cash | Bank
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
01/04 | Capital A/c |       | 20k  | 30k  | 03/04 | Purchase A/c | 500   | 10k  | -
```

### 🔹 Balancing the Cash Book

* Total the debit and credit sides.
* The difference is carried forward as closing balance.
* Cash balance can never be negative.

### 🔹 Petty Cash Book

A petty cash book is used to record small, repetitive expenses like postage, stationery, etc.

#### Imprest System:

* A fixed amount is given to the petty cashier.
* Expenses are recorded daily.
* At the end of the period, the spent amount is reimbursed.

#### Format Example:

```
Date | Particulars    | Postage | Stationery | Misc. | Total
-------------------------------------------------------------
05/04 | Pens & Paper   |         | 50         |       | 50
06/04 | Courier Charge | 30      |            |       | 30
```

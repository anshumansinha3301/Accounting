## **Module-I: Understanding the Nature of Accounting**

### ðŸ”¹ What is Accounting?

Accounting is the systematic process of **identifying**, **measuring**, **recording**, **classifying**, **summarizing**, **interpreting**, and **communicating** financial information. The primary goal is to provide accurate and timely financial data to users for decision-making.

### ðŸ”¹ Functions of Accounting

1. **Recording**: Also known as bookkeeping. It involves systematically documenting all financial transactions.
2. **Classifying**: Grouping similar items under a common category (e.g., salaries under expenses).
3. **Summarizing**: Preparing reports like Trial Balance, Profit & Loss A/c, and Balance Sheet.
4. **Interpreting**: Analyzing the summarized data to understand the financial health.
5. **Communicating**: Sharing the interpreted data with internal and external stakeholders.

### ðŸ”¹ Usefulness of Accounting

* Provides financial information to management for decision-making.
* Aids in performance evaluation and budgeting.
* Necessary for statutory compliance and tax filings.
* Facilitates comparison between different time periods and firms.

### ðŸ”¹ Accounting Equation

* **Formula**: `Assets = Liabilities + Ownerâ€™s Equity`
* This equation shows the relationship between the three fundamental elements of accounting.

#### ðŸ“Œ Numerical Example:

Owner starts a business by investing â‚¹1,00,000.

* Assets (Cash): â‚¹1,00,000
* Liabilities: â‚¹0
* Owner's Equity: â‚¹1,00,000

Buys equipment for â‚¹30,000 on credit:

* Assets increase (Equipment) â‚¹30,000
* Liabilities increase (Creditors) â‚¹30,000

### ðŸ”¹ Accounting Concepts and GAAP

#### 1. **Business Entity Concept**

The business is treated as a separate legal entity from its owners. Personal expenses of the owner are not recorded in the business books.

#### 2. **Money Measurement Concept**

Only those events that can be measured in monetary terms are recorded. For example, employee satisfaction is not recorded.

#### 3. **Going Concern Concept**

Assumes the business will operate indefinitely and not liquidate in the foreseeable future.

#### 4. **Cost Concept**

Assets are recorded at their purchase cost, not at market value or resale value.

#### 5. **Dual Aspect Concept**

Every transaction affects at least two accounts. This is the basis for the double-entry system.

#### 6. **Accrual Concept**

Transactions are recorded when they occur, not when cash is exchanged.

#### 7. **Matching Concept**

Expenses should be recognized in the same period as the revenues they help to generate.

#### 8. **Revenue Recognition Concept**

Revenue is recognized when it is earned, regardless of when the payment is received.

#### 9. **Conservatism (Prudence)**

Anticipate all possible losses but do not anticipate profits.

#### 10. **Materiality**

Only significant items that affect decision-making need to be disclosed.

#### 11. **Consistency**

The same accounting methods should be applied consistently across periods.

#### 12. **Objectivity**

Accounts should be based on objective evidence, such as invoices, receipts, and contracts.

### ðŸ”¹ GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles)

These are standardized guidelines used in accounting to ensure clarity, consistency, and comparability in the preparation of financial statements.

### ðŸ”¹ IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards)

A globally accepted framework issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that standardizes accounting across international borders. It emphasizes fair value and principle-based accounting.

## **Module-II: Double Entry System and the Accounting Cycle**

### ðŸ”¹ Concept of Double Entry

The double-entry system of accounting means every transaction affects at least two accountsâ€”one debit and one creditâ€”with the total debits equaling total credits. This system maintains the accounting equation and ensures accurate financial reporting.

### ðŸ”¹ The Accounting Cycle

The accounting cycle is the complete process of:

1. **Identifying Transactions**
2. **Recording in Journal (Journal Entries)**
3. **Posting to Ledger**
4. **Preparing Trial Balance**
5. **Adjusting Entries**
6. **Preparing Adjusted Trial Balance**
7. **Creating Financial Statements (P\&L, Balance Sheet)**
8. **Closing the Books**

### ðŸ”¹ Vouchers

2. **Bank Voucher** â€“ for transactions via bank.
3. **Journal Voucher** â€“ for non-cash transactions like depreciation.
4. **Purchase Voucher** â€“ records purchase transactions.
5. **Sales Voucher** â€“ records sales transactions.

#### Objective of Preparing Vouchers:

## **Module-III: Subsidiary Books and Cash Book**

### ðŸ”¹ Introduction and Need for Subsidiary Books

```

### ðŸ”¹ Balancing the Cash Book

### ðŸ”¹ Petty Cash Book

A petty cash book is used to record small, repetitive expenses like postage, stationery, etc.
